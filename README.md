# SZL Atelier

Walk every Hugging Face model id under [SZLHOLDINGS](https://huggingface.co/SZLHOLDINGS). Forty cards. Unique cuts. GitHub-aligned Python. Kernel playgrounds that run in the browser.

YAML `emoji` is Hub metadata, not product chrome. System fonts. No Google Fonts. Gold is OPEN. Never green-as-proven. Never a fabricated joule.

**Runtime target:** Docker on Hugging Face Spaces. Canonical surface: [SZLHOLDINGS/szl-atelier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SZLHOLDINGS/szl-atelier).

| Origin | Role |
|---|---|
| [szl-holdings/szl-atelier](https://github.com/szl-holdings/szl-atelier) | Source of this Space |
| [a11oy.net/atelier](https://a11oy.net/atelier/) | Proof-registry copy |
| [a-11-oy.com/atelier](https://a-11-oy.com/atelier) | Product surface |
| [SZLHOLDINGS/szl-khipu](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SZLHOLDINGS/szl-khipu) | Sibling Gradio hologram |

## Runtime contract

The frontend and Python backend are served from one origin. `/healthz` proves that the FastAPI process is responding; `/readyz` fails closed unless the catalog and release manifest are present and the expected 40 records load; `/api/build-info` reports hashes for the bytes served by the container. `/api/frontier/verify` validates the structure and scope of browser-generated frontier receipts without pretending that a local measurement is a production deployment or a cryptographic signature.

Receipt persistence is **NOT CONFIGURED**. Verification requests are not stored. Provider repository state and served runtime state remain separate evidence and are checked during release.

## The cut

Anthropic taught refuse. NVIDIA taught kernels and joules. Unsloth taught cheap QLoRA. SZL spends all three on a typed plan, a fail-closed gate, and a training receipt you can verify without trusting us.

## Honesty

| Claim | Label |
|---|---|
| 40 Hub model ids | HUB |
| Python API and readiness contract | RUNTIME-OBSERVED only when `/readyz` returns 200 |
| Nano silhouettes (moons, embed, tiny-khipu, receipt, λ*) | MEASURED in this Space |
| SZL-Khipu-1.5B plan-valid 11/11, grounding 4/5, abstain 2/6, hallu 0 | SIGNED — not retrained here |
| MiniEmbed hit@2 0.40 | SAMPLE on five pairs. Hub analogy UNAVAILABLE |
| Λ uniqueness | Conjecture 1 OPEN |
| Energy / CUDA | UNAVAILABLE |
| GGUF | derived, never the signed object |
